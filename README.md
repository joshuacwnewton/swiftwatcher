# swiftwatcher
> A collaboration between the University of Victoria's Computer Vision 
Lab and Algoma SwiftWatch

`swiftwatcher` is a open-source tool written in Python which 
automatically counts chimney swifts in video files _(so you don't have 
to!)_ It uses ideas from the field of computer vision to locate and 
track birds within a video's frames, and detect when a bird has entered 
a chimney.

## Getting Started

Swiftwatcher is provided as a single executable file which can be run by
itself. This file can be downloaded from the Releases page, 
[found here](https://github.com/joshuacwnewton/swiftwatcher/releases). 

Each release on the Releases page has an "Assets" section containing 
compressed archives for both Linux and Windows operating systems. These 
archives are named `win` or `linux`, and contain `swiftwatcher` 
executable files.

#### Usage Instructions

Once you have downloaded the file corresponding to your operating system, 
please follow these steps to use swiftwatcher:

1. Extract and run the program you downloaded from the Releases page. 
    * **Linux:** swiftwatcher can be run from the command line by typing

        `./swiftwatcher`
    * **Windows:** swiftwatcher can be run by double-clicking it, or
    from the command line by typing 
    
        `swiftwatcher.exe`
2. You will be prompted to select the video files you wish to analyse.
Hold `shift` + `click` to select multiple videos.
3. Once all videos have been selected and confirmed, you will be 
prompted to decide whether or not to re-use the chimney that was 
identified in the first video. (Use this option if the chimney position
does not change across all videos you wish to analyse.)
4. If the file(s) you selected are valid video files, you will then
be shown a frame from the first video, and prompted to select the two 
corners which represent the chimney in the video. When two points are 
selected, you can proceed with the 'y' key or select again with the 'n' 
key. If there are more chimneys to define, this process will repeat.
5. When the chimney has been identified for all videos, 
the application will begin to process them to look for swifts.

This process can be viewed in the demonstration below.

Results will be outputted to a folder of the same name as the video 
file. Within this folder, you will find `.csv` files in a number of 
different time formats. Each `.csv` file contains three columns: 

* **TMSTAMP:** The in-video timestamp corresponding to the counted 
swifts.
* **PREDICTED:** What the application counts as a swift entering the 
chimney.
* **REJECTED:** A potential event that did not meet the 
necessary criteria to be counted. 

Counts are only determined from **PREDICTED** swifts, but **REJECTED**
counts are included for transparency.
